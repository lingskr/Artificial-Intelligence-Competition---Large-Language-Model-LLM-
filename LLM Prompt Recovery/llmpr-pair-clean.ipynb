Diplomonads Among the Excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite, Giardia lamblia (Figure 23.10). Until recently, these protists were believed to lack mitochondria. Mitochondrial remnant organelles, called mitosomes, have since been identified in diplomonads, but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional. Diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as glycolysis, to generate energy.

       "       [' I\\'ve always been a bit of a nerd when it comes to fitness and health. So, one day, I decided to join a local gym to start building some muscle. As I was working out, an elderly gentleman approached me and asked if I could help him understand the workout routine posted on the wall. Of course, I agreed!\\n\\nHe pointed to a picture of a man doing bicep curls and said, \"Young man, can you tell me what it is this fella is trying to build here?\" With a grin, I replied, \"Well sir, he\\'s trying to build his muscles on his arms.\" To my surprise, the old man shook his head and said, \"No no, look again. It says \\'bodybuilder,\\' so he must want to build his whole body!\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t help but laugh at how literal the question had been taken. But then, I realized there might actually be something to learn from this interaction. This sweet old man, who may have never stepped foot inside a gym before, saw the term \"bodybuilder\" and immediately thought about the entirety of a person - rather than just individual parts. In a way, I admired his perspective; seeing things holistically instead of focusing on singular components.\\n\\nFast forward a couple weeks later, during my usual weightlifting session, I noticed a peculiar smell wafting through the air. Soon enough, I traced its source to a water bottle lying next to another gymgoer. Curious, I peered inside only to discover that it contained motor oil! Shocked, I quickly alerted the staff who swiftly escorted the man outside.\\n\\nAs people around us buzzed with confusion and amusement, I found myself reflecting on both incidents. Both instances showed individuals approaching exercise and physical wellness differently – one taking an all-encompassing viewpoint while the other...well, let\\'s say they took an unconventional approach. However strange these encounters were, they reminded me of two essential aspects of life: inclusivity and innovation. By embracing diversity in perspectives, whether related to fitness or anything else, we foster growth and learning within ourselves and our communities. And sometimes, thinking outside the box leads to extraordinary breakthroughs.\\n\\nSo remember, keep pushing your limits, stay open-minded, and don\\'t forget to check your water bottles for motor oil!',\n",

       "       [\" A few months back, I came across a post about the fascinating wildlife in Madagascar while browsing through Reddit's r/EarthPorn subreddit – yes, my niche interest lies in admiring beautiful landscapes! One image showcased a breathtaking view of Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, and it sparked my curiosity about how such a unique landscape could exist.\\n\\nI started reading more about Madagascar's geographical history and discovered that its separation from Africa around 88 million years ago played a significant role in shaping the island's one-of-a-kind ecosystems. With no large mammalian predators sharing the land until human arrival, many interesting animals evolved there, like the peculiar lemurs and carnivorous fossas. Around 90% of the plants and animals living in Madagascar can only be found on this incredible island.\\n\\nAs I read further, I stumbled upon something unusual. Some redditors were discussing the theft of Malagasy chameleons as part of the exotic pet trade, particularly the rare Parson's Chameleon (Calumma parsonii). It struck me then; even though I loved learning about these magnificent creatures online, I never truly considered their potential exploitation due to growing demand. That day marked an unexpected plot twist in my journey as a passive enthusiast.\\n\\nFeeling troubled, I began researching conservation efforts surrounding these precious beings. Fortunately, organizations like Madagascar Fauna Group and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust work tirelessly to protect them. But they need our help too. My eyes opened wide at seeing so many opportunities where people just like me could contribute—from donating money to volunteering time to spreading awareness.\\n\\nThis experience made me realize we all play a vital part in preserving nature. Our actions matter, whether it's appreciating stunning vistas virtually or actively contributing towards protecting fragile ecosystems. After all, isn't finding common ground among strangers what makes communities thrive? In this case, it was discovering the beauty of Madagascar together and deciding to take action against threats facing its amazing biodiversity. So here I am now, doing my bit to share knowledge and support initiatives working to conserve Madagascar's rich natural heritage.\",\n",

       "       [' In the small town of Harmonyville, the city council was facing a difficult decision regarding the repair of the aging water treatment plant. The mayor, Mr. Thompson, had called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue. Three options were presented to the council members - Option A: Repair the current facility, Option B: Build a new state-of-the-art plant, and Option C: Outsource the water supply to a neighboring town.\\n\\nMayor Thompson opened the discussion: \"Our trusted engineer has provided us with a report outlining the risks associated with each option.\" He then read aloud the following statement:\\n\\n\"Statement: This report provides valuable information for our risk assessments and budgetary decisions.\"\\n\\nHe proceeded to reveal the three possible interpretations of the statement:\\n\\nChoice 1: These reports are incredibly important; however, it is rare for them to be accessible to the general public.\\nChoice 2: Reports like this play a crucial role when evaluating potential risks and financial implications.\\nChoice 3: Honestly, I don\\'t think those kinds of reports are particularly helpful.\\n\\nCouncilwoman Johnson spoke up first: \"I agree wholeheartedly with Choice 2, Mayor. We need to take full advantage of this expert analysis so that we make informed decisions about the future of our town.\" Her affirmation supported Options A and B.\\n\\nOn the contrary, Councilman Brown expressed his skepticism by saying, \"As much as I respect our engineer, I still believe Choice 3 holds some truth—how reliable could these technical documents really be?\" His dismissive attitude leaned more towards outsourcing (Option C).\\n\\nTension filled the room until Mayor Thompson intervened: \"Let\\'s remember why we sought outside help in the first place: due diligence demanded unbiased expertise beyond what we possess internally. Our goal here isn\\'t merely to reach a consensus but to ensure Harmonyville thrives sustainably.\"\\n\\nCommon sense prevailed, prompting further investigation into all three alternatives before reaching any conclusions.

       "       ['There are two ways of constructing colors—additive (e.g., RGB) and subtractive (e.g., CMYK). Additive colors are “added” to black, and for them, the answer is simple: you make them “darker” by reducing the amount you’re adding, and when you reach zero you’re at black.\\n\\nFor subtractive colors, the answer is a bit more complex. The bandwidth of light blocked by each of the primary subtractive colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) is narrower than the bandwidth the corresponding cone cells in your eye are able to respond to—this is necessary in order to create fully-saturated primary colors that trigger a single type of cone without “crossing over” and triggering other cones as well. But this means that there are some frequencies of visible light *between* the primary subtractive colors that aren’t blocked by them and will still be visible no matter how “dark” you make the primaries. (That’s why it’s necessary to add black to cyan, magenta, and yellow for CMYK printing.)\\n\\nAt least, that’s the case if you have a full-spectrum light source. If your light source were only emitting pure red, green, and blue frequencies (like the light from an RGB monitor), then you could indeed make black using fully-saturated subtractive primary colors.',\n",

       "       [\" I wanted to share my personal experience since the legalization of marijuana in our state last year. My husband, John, lost his construction job due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. We were struggling to make ends meet and provide for our three kids. I was working two jobs just to keep us afloat, but it wasn't enough.\\n\\nOne day, while scrolling through Facebook, I saw an ad about a local Cannabis dispensary looking for budtenders. I knew nothing about marijuana, but the thought of making a decent wage and having benefits like health insurance and paid time off seemed too good to pass up. So, I applied, and surprisingly, they hired me!\\n\\nJohn was hesitant at first, worried about the stigma attached to working in the cannabis industry. But we both agreed that we needed to do whatever it took to get back on our feet financially. Soon after starting my new job, I realized how much this industry has positively affected our community. Our town has seen a significant increase in tourism, leading to more customers visiting local businesses, including ours.\\n\\nMoreover, the taxes generated from marijuana sales helped fund several school renovation projects and even provided additional resources for mental health services within our district. It felt great knowing that my work contributed to improving the lives of those around me.\\n\\nBut then came the unexpected plot twist. A few months into my new career, I discovered that my own teenage son had started using marijuana recreationally. He admitted he'd been buying it from friends who obtained it illegally because he didn't want to risk getting caught purchasing it from a dispensary with his mom as an employee. This revelation broke my heart.\\n\\nAs someone who works in the industry, I understand the potential benefits of cannabis use for adults. However, seeing my child struggle with it made me question whether legalization was worth the risks. Was I contributing to a problem bigger than helping our family and community?\\n\\nDespite these challenges, I chose to stay in my job and continue advocating for responsible use and age restrictions. Working in the cannabis industry has taught me valuable lessons about compassion, understanding, and resilience. And although there are still struggles along the way, I remain hopeful that my efforts will create a better future for all involved – especially my children.\",\n",
       "        \"The Cannabis Budtender\\n\\nIn the wake of the pandemic's economic devastation, John's construction job vanished like a gust of wind, leaving the family grappling with financial instability and the daunting task of providing for their three kids. Their struggle mirrored countless others who had been thrust into a precarious position, the weight of the world seemingly unbearable.\\n\\nBut fate intervened in the most unexpected way. While scrolling through Facebook one fateful day, Sarah stumbled upon an advertisement for a local Cannabis dispensary seeking budtenders. Knowing nothing about marijuana, she felt an audacious glimmer of opportunity amidst the chaos. Despite John's reservations and the stigma attached to the industry, she applied and to her astonishment, she won the coveted position.\\n\\nThe job presented not only a paycheck but also a sense of purpose. The dispensary became a hub of activity, drawing hordes of customers and infusing the town with a newfound vitality. The taxes generated from marijuana sales trickled down to fund school renovations and provide additional resources for mental health services. It seemed like her work, albeit unconventional, was contributing to a positive ripple effect.\\n\\nHowever, fate took a cruel turn when she discovered that her teenage son, a bright and innocent soul, had succumbed to the allure of marijuana. The heartbreaking revelation shattered her joy and made her question the seemingly harmless nature of the substance. She confronted the jarring reality that her own job might be inadvertently enabling her child's struggles.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, Sarah persevered, refusing to let her personal anguish compromise her professionalism and her ability to advocate for responsible use and age restrictions. She realized that her journey had taught her valuable lessons about compassion, understanding, and resilience. It had shown her the power of empathy and the transformative capacity of second chances and support.\\n\\nThe story of the Cannabis Budtender encapsulates the complexities of a remarkable journey marked by both triumphs and tribulations. It's a tale of resilience, transformation, and the delicate interplay between personal ambition and societal impact.\"],\n",
